Microsoft has been revamping Windows to make it more attractive to developers. Especially with the new release of Windows 11, we have revealed some very exciting news both for Windows users and developers! Windows is now THE open platform for developers. This means everyone has open access to run the widest range of apps on Windows, enabling all developers to build the apps and experiences that empower users to create, learn, and play.   

This repository is dedicated to help students and early-in-career developers to get started with Windows development.
