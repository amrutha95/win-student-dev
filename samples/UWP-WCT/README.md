# Build an awesome UWP application with beautiful Windows Community Toolkit

This repo shows a simple sample using the 7.1.1 version of the Windows Community Toolkit and the [`ListDetailsView`](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/communitytoolkit/controls/masterdetailsview) control. Link to accompanying video: https://aka.ms/win-dev/student/osu/uwp-wct/get-started-video

It needs Visual Studio 2019 or later to build with the Universal Windows Platform Development workload. See more details in the base [UWP](../UWP/uwp.md) sample of this repo or from the [getting started docs here](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/get-started/your-first-app).
